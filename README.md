# Contact-Aware Dynamics Demo

This repository contains a prototype implementation of a predictive model for object-gripper interaction dynamics in robotic manipulation. It estimates object keypoints and tactile feedback given visual input and motion actions.

## Features

- Simulates motion decomposition into sub-actions
- Predicts object keypoints over time
- Simulates and classifies tactile feedback
- Modular: easily swap models (diffusion, transformer, etc.)

## Installation

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
